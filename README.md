# Face-Mask-Detection

In the Face Mask Detection project, machine learning techniques are used to detect individuals who are wearing masks and those who are not. The goal is to develop a model capable of identifying mask-wearing status based on facial images. This system can be valuable in public safety applications or environments that require mask compliance verification.

# Project Components:
Data Collection: Collecting images of individuals both with and without masks.
Data Preparation: Processing and adjusting the images to ensure they are suitable for the model.
Model Development: Training a classification model using machine learning algorithms to determine mask-wearing status.
Model Testing and Evaluation: Measuring the model's accuracy and assessing its performance using a test dataset.

# Project Applications:
This face mask detection system can be applied in surveillance systems, automated compliance checks in institutions, or at the entrances of public buildings.
